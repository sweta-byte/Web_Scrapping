Given the large number of vehicles that have made their way to Indian streets, the need for insurance has also grown tremendously in recent years. Although the purchase of a new car can be exciting, it is important to consider potential accidents that may occur and damage your vehicle. In such situations, a car insurance policy can come in handy as it will significantly lower the costs incurred on repairing the vehicle or replacing its parts. Car insurance is required mainly for the following reasons:Purchasing a car insurance policy can financially protect you as well as your vehicle in times of accidents. Given the rate at which new vehicles are entering Indian roads on a daily basis, having a car insurance policy in place is crucial as there are several perils of driving in the country. Here are five ways through which you can be protected with car insurance:The following are a few add-on covers that you can purchase with your car insurance policy to make it more comprehensive and effective:\\r\\n                  Purchasing this cover will ensure that you receive a full claim on the cost of the car parts replaced following an accident. This cover is usually provided only for the initial 3 years from the date on which the car was purchased. As the vehicle ages, the premium for this cover gets steeper.\\r\\n               \\r\\n                  In case you are faced with an emergency when driving in a remote area, the roadside assistance cover will provide you with access to services that can fix your problems as soon as possible.\\r\\n               \\r\\n                  A personal accident cover provides coverage to the owner of a car in case of accidents. If the owner of the car is driving it and meets with an accident, 100% of the claim amount will be provided to him/her in case of irreparable damage to limbs or death.\\r\\n               \\r\\n                  A no-claim bonus is a reward for policyholders who do not make any insurance claims over the course of a policy year. In such cases, this cover rewards them by providing discounts of up to 50% on the premium payment for the following year.\\r\\n               \\r\\n                  This add-on cover provides protection to the electronic circuit and the engine of the vehicle. In case of flooding, the engine can fail if you keep trying to run it, and this damage is not covered by regular car insurance policies.\\r\\n               \\r\\n                  This add-on cover allows you to report claims because of loss or theft of your personal belongings. In case you leave your laptop or some other expensive equipment in your locked car and it gets stolen, this cover will reimburse you for the loss at least partly if not fully.\\r\\n               \\r\\n                  In case your vehicle remains in a garage for about three to four days, the daily cash allowance cover will pay for your transportation costs. However, this cover is not too popular among Indian car owners due to the fact that repairs usually take just a day or two.\\r\\n               \\r\\n                  In case you misplace or lose your car keys, having a key replacement cover will ensure that you are reimbursed for the cost of replacing the key. However, insurance companies do not reimburse the whole amount needed to replace the key.\\r\\n               It is very simple to make your car insurance policy stronger and have comprehensive coverage in difficult times. It is essential to consider the aforementioned covers as they will not only come to your rescue when needed, but will also lower the costs you would otherwise incur if you did not have them. However, not all add-on covers may be beneficial for you, so it is advised that you go through them carefully and pick the ones that could come in handy.Car insurance can be purchased through agents, dealers, or brokers. AgentsInsurance agents work with insurance companies and are paid by the company to sell their products to customers. As such, agents are experts so far as the insurance products offered by their employers are concerned. They have the ability and the expertise to guide you and help you choose the policy that best suits your needs. If you wish to change your insurance company, you should find another insurance agent who works with the company from which you wish to purchase insurance. DealersAutomobile dealers sell vehicles to customers, and these vehicles are sold with third-party liability insurance. Generally, dealers have tie-ups with insurance companies and may not be experts regarding the insurance policies. They take care of the paperwork associated with availing a third-party liability insurance policy sold by the dealership, but do not have adequate knowledge to guide you to find the policy that best suits your requirements. BrokersBrokers can either be individuals or companies that have a license from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to sell insurance products.
